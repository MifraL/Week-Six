Reading 1: Michelle Moravec, Visualizing Schneemannn American Art History and Digital Scholarship: New Avenues of Exploration, November 15, 2013 http://historyinthecity.blogspot.com/2013/11/before-i-start-i-want-to-thank-people.html .

-	The author has been studying the link between feminist art and the women’s liberation movement when she came across Carolee Schneemann who was central figure in her research.
-	It is interesting to not that the author used Antconc, to do a preliminary corpus linguistics analysis of Schneemann’s letters. Because, We used in week 4, I can understand better the analysis.
-	It is interesting that the patterns reveal that most of the correspondence were sent male…
-	The use of the word “the past” in her letters, frames her present situation.
-	I liked the article because it showed the use of application that I was familiar through this class and I could process how she got to her results and what she was trying to do in terms of her research, way better.
