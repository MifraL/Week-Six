Network 

-	Databasic

And gephi 
-	Did not work as well because there was no clutter as I had chosen the diary of the same person 

Image analysis 

- It was pretty great, the barcode was looking great I believe because the covers were mostly simple it showed the color tones better….
- I liked the visual impact.

Ocr 

-	I had trouble with the code because I forgot to change jpg to png and putting the correct folder name into the code. 
	
Posters

-	I tried doing a collage in the inkscape but it’s looked messy and childish so I did sound

Sound 

-	Because the data was chosen by me, I understood the sound better… like how as the years progressed for the diary, the piano notes would rise.
